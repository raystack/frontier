  title: Frontier Administration API
  description: The Frontier APIs adhere to the OpenAPI specification, also known as Swagger, which provides a standardized approach for designing, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs. With OpenAPI, you gain a clear understanding of the API endpoints, request/response structures, and authentication mechanisms supported by the Frontier APIs. By leveraging the OpenAPI specification, developers can easily explore and interact with the Frontier APIs using a variety of tools and libraries. The OpenAPI specification enables automatic code generation, interactive API documentation, and seamless integration with API testing frameworks, making it easier than ever to integrate Frontier into your existing applications and workflows.

    description: |-
      Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
      payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or
      an HTML page.


      This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in
      the request as well as the response.

      It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one
      wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
      request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.

      Example:

          message GetResourceRequest {
            // A unique request id.
            string request_id = 1;

            // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
            google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;

          }

          service ResourceService {
            rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest)
              returns (google.api.HttpBody);
            rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody)
              returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

          }

      Example with streaming methods:

          service CaldavService {
            rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
              returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
            rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
              returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);

          }

      Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are
      handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.

          A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
          the fully qualified name of the type (as in
          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
            value in binary format, or produce an error.
          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
            breaking changes.)

          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
          type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely used type server
          implementations and no plans to implement one.

          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
          used with implementation specific semantics.

      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any;
          any.PackFrom(foo);
          ...
          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
            ...
          }

      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
          ...
          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
          }
          // or ...
          if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
            foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
          }

       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

          foo = Foo(...)
          any = Any()
          any.Pack(foo)
          ...
          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
            any.Unpack(foo)
            ...

       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
           any, err := anypb.New(foo)
           if err != nil {
             ...
           }
           ...
           foo := &pb.Foo{}
           if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
             ...
           }

      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
      name "y.z".

      JSON
      ====
      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

          package google.profile;
          message Person {
            string first_name = 1;
            string last_name = 2;
          }

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
            "firstName": <string>,
            "lastName": <string>
          }

      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
      representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
            "value": "1.212s"
          }
  protobufNullValue:
    type: string
    enum:
      - NULL_VALUE
    default: NULL_VALUE
    description: |-
      `NullValue` is a singleton enumeration to represent the null value for the
      `Value` type union.

      The JSON representation for `NullValue` is JSON `null`.

       - NULL_VALUE: Null value.
